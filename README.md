### The Problem
Managing personal finances effectively requires tracking expenses, forecasting cash flow, and maintaining organized spending lists—all while juggling daily responsibilities.

### The Solution
A comprehensive budgeting app that:
- 📊 **Tracks finances in real-time** with an intuitive dashboard
- 🛒 **Manages shopping lists** with smart categorization and details
- 🔄 **Forecasts future expenses** based on recurring purchases
- 🤖 **Leverages AI** to parse unstructured text (receipts, notes) into structured shopping items
- ✅ **Syncs with Todoist** to integrate shopping with task management
- 📈 **Plans for AI analytics** to identify spending patterns and provide actionable insights

### Skills Demonstrated
- **Financial Planning**: Understanding cashflow, budgets, and expense forecasting
- **Systems Integration**: Connecting multiple tools (Todoist, AI) into one cohesive workflow
- **Data Organization**: Structuring financial information for clarity and analysis
- **Automation**: Reducing manual data entry through AI parsing
- **Process Design**: Creating user-friendly workflows for daily financial management

### Tech Stack
TypeScript, React, Python, FastAPI, SQLite

## 📚 Project 2: Exam Study Tracker

An intelligent study planning system that helps manage exam preparation across multiple subjects with visual progress tracking.

### Screenshot

### The Problem
Preparing for multiple exams requires coordinating study materials, tracking progress across subjects, and maintaining a clear schedule—all while adapting to changing priorities.

### The Solution
A smart study tracker that:
- 📅 **Visualizes study schedules** with a continuous calendar from first task to final exam
- ☑️ **Tracks completion** with interactive checklists and live progress percentages
- 🔄 **Enables flexible rescheduling** with multi-select task movement
- 🎯 **Highlights priorities** with today markers and zero-progress warnings
- 🤖 **Uses AI for planning** via YAML configuration files that AI tools can process to generate optimized study schedules
- 💾 **Auto-saves progress** to prevent data loss

### AI Integration Approach
The tracker uses YAML files to define subjects, materials, and schedules. This structured format allows me to:
1. Upload YAML templates to AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
2. Provide exam information and study materials
3. Have AI generate optimized, personalized study schedules
4. Import the AI-generated schedules directly into the tracker

This demonstrates practical AI usage without complex integration—leveraging AI as a planning assistant.

### Skills Demonstrated
- **Project Planning**: Breaking down large goals (exam prep) into manageable tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Monitoring completion and identifying bottlenecks
- **Time Management**: Allocating study time effectively across subjects
- **Adaptability**: Quick rescheduling when priorities change
- **Structured Data Design**: Creating formats (YAML) that enable AI assistance
- **Self-Management**: Building systems to stay organized and accountable

### Tech Stack
JavaScript, Python, HTML/CSS, YAML configuration

### Repository Status
Private (contains personal study information) — Available for review upon request

## 🎓 Philosophy

I believe the best learning comes from solving real problems. Rather than building theoretical projects, I create tools I actually use daily. This ensures they're practical, user-friendly, and genuinely valuable—qualities that translate directly to professional work.

Every challenge is an opportunity to build a better system. 🚀
